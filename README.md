# DATA ANALYSIS WITH SQL
This repo comprises of different database files where I have used different Structured Query Language (SQL) to 
- manage relational database systems
- validate and clean datasets
- extract useful information
- provide profound insights about data sets 
- and answer basic questions about datasets

I have used these projects to highlight some of my SQL skills.
